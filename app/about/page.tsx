          I grew up in Tokyo with a deep fascination for American movies and TV
          shows, which inspired a dream to explore the United States. At 15, I
          took a leap and became an international exchange student in Georgia,
          experiencing American culture firsthand.

          After graduating high school, my college journey took me across the
          U.S.â€”from the sunny vibes of Bay Area of California to the plains of
          Wyoming and even the quiet rural areas of upstate New York. While
          playing collegiate football, I explored various career paths but
          struggled to find a clear direction.

          In 2019, I unexpectedly developed a passion for learning Spanish.
          Despite struggling with the language in high school and college, I
          embraced self-study, using tools like Duolingo to improve. Motivated
          by my progress, I began my career in Mexico, working as an Assistant
          Manager at a logistics company for nearly three years.

          I later transitioned to a role at Casio as a Sales Planning Executive,
          but it became clear that my interests lay elsewhere. That realization
          led me to pursue a career in tech. I returned to Japan in 2023,
          completed an intensive web development bootcamp at Le Wagon, and began
          my journey as a frontend developer in Tokyo.

        <p className="mb-5 leading-relaxed text-muted">
          My transition into programming wasn&apos;t a straight path. Working in
          corporate roles made me reflect on the significance of meaningful
          work. During my time in Mexico City, I encountered digital nomads
          whose lifestyles inspired me to explore coding.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5 leading-relaxed text-muted">
          At first, programming felt like learning an entirely new language, but
          I quickly found it thrilling. I immersed myself in learning, attended
          a bootcamp, and connected with tech enthusiasts at meetups, which
          expanded my perspective and reshaped my career path.

          My first role as a full-stack engineer at a digital consulting firm
          exposed me to a variety of technologies and industries. The fast-paced
          nature of client work honed my adaptability and problem-solving
          skills. Seeking a more focused environment, I transitioned to a
          product-driven company specializing in logistics digital services.

        <p className="mb-5 leading-relaxed text-muted">
          Currently, I work as a software engineer, collaborating with
          cross-functional teams to develop scalable systems and improve user
          experiences. My role enables me to apply my technical expertise while
          continuously growing and tackling new challenges.
