# How App Development Has Changed: Building a Goal-Tracking App in Just One Week

I want to write about the creation of this app, which only took one week to
finish. It's my first app integration with the OpenAI API and also my first time
using Supabase. Most importantly, it's my first time creating an app with Claude
Code.

What I want to highlight is how much app development has changed in this short
period of time. Six months ago, I developed a calendar app with Next.js and
Rails API. It was very difficult because Claude Code wasn't a thing before, and
even though I used LLMs, I probably coded half of the code on my own.

This time, I used Claude to set everything up from the beginning. However, LLMs
are at a junior level - you need to give very specific instructions to make them
work effectively. My first prompt to create this app was more than 100 lines of
detailed instructions.

## What the App Does

The app is a goal-tracking system that helps users achieve their objectives
through AI-powered planning and daily task management. Users input their goals,
current skill level, and time availability, and the app generates a personalized
roadmap with daily tasks.

The core workflow is simple: define your goal, let AI create a structured plan,
and track your progress through an interactive calendar. The app adapts to your
schedule and provides intelligent recommendations to keep you on track.

What makes it special is the AI integration - instead of generic task lists, it
creates contextual, skill-level-appropriate tasks that consider your real-world
constraints like time availability and current expertise.

## Server Actions & Server Components: The Game Changers

One of the most exciting parts of this project was finally getting to use
Next.js 15's Server Actions and Server Components properly. I'd been curious
about them for a while, but this was my first time diving deep, and honestly,
they changed everything about how I build apps.

The coolest thing about **Server Actions** is that I didn't need to create any
API routes at all. Usually, I'd have to build separate endpoints for things like
creating goals, marking tasks as complete, or generating AI roadmaps. This time,
I just wrote server functions and called them directly from my components. No
more switching between frontend and backend mindsets constantly.

**Server Components** handled all the data fetching and initial rendering on the
server. My dashboard, goal lists, and calendar views all render on the server
with fresh data, then stream to the client. This means faster initial page loads
and better SEO.

**What I loved about this approach:**

- **Faster Development**: No more switching between frontend and backend
  contexts
- **Better Performance**: Server-side rendering with streaming for instant page
  loads
- **Simplified Architecture**: Eliminated the need for a separate API layer
  entirely
- **Type Safety**: Direct function calls instead of HTTP requests means better
  TypeScript integration
- **Less Boilerplate**: No more API route files, request/response handling, or
  client-side loading states for initial data

This architecture choice was crucial for completing the app in just one week.
The reduced complexity meant I could focus on features rather than
infrastructure.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend & Framework**

- Next.js 15 (App Router + React 19)
- React Server Components (RSC)
- Server Actions for forms
- Turbopack (Rust-based bundler)

**Backend & Database**

- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Real-time)
- Row Level Security (RLS)

**Package Manager**

- Bun (25x faster than npm)

**UI & Styling**

- Shadcn/ui v2 + Tailwind CSS v4
- Radix UI primitives
- Lucide React icons
- Framer Motion v11

**State & Data**

- Jotai (Atomic state management)
- TanStack Query v5 (Serverstate)
- React Hook Form v7 + Zod v3

**AI & External APIs**

- OpenAI SDK v5 with streaming â€¢ Custom prompt engineering

**Development Tools**

- TypeScript 5.5+
- Vitest (Testing)
- ESLint + Prettier

## My Experience and Learnings

Some of the tech stack like Next.js, React, Jotai, React Hook Form, and Vitest I
already use at my current work, but it was my first time using Supabase and
React Query. I also instructed a specific file structure from the beginning.

The thing is, I've been using Next.js for my work for more than 6 months, and I
had already set up one project from scratch in my previous work. That knowledge
definitely helped me build faster than before. I also really wanted to try React
Query with Server Actions and server-side components, and I removed the API
layer for this project, which made development even faster.

However, sometimes the AI can't fix bugs, and it's faster to fix them by
googling. AI coding assistance is powerful, but without the knowledge to use
that power effectively, I don't think you can utilize it 100%.

## The Real Challenge: From App to Business

Initially, I thought I could make this app monetized, but halfway through
development, I realized I couldn't really imagine people paying for this thing.
So I gave up on the monetization idea and decided to just make this app as my
portfolio piece.

This taught me an important lesson: while it's gotten much faster to build apps
from scratch than before, it's incredibly hard to come up with an idea that can
actually work as a business. The technical barriers have lowered dramatically,
but the business validation part - that's the harder challenge now.

Building the app is no longer the bottleneck; finding a problem worth solving
and that people will pay for is where the real difficulty lies. And since it's
easier to build apps now, everyone will try to make their own startup, which
means there will be more competitors than before. The market is becoming more
saturated with apps, making it even harder to stand out.

## Key Takeaways

In this era, I feel like it's important to know about the tech stack you're
using and use LLMs to handle the tedious tasks. But it's very important to know
what the LLM is writing all the time, and you need to act like you're giving
instructions to a junior developer.

If you lose control and get lost in what the LLM is writing, it becomes much
harder to debug. The key is maintaining oversight and understanding while
leveraging AI to accelerate the development process.

The speed of development has increased dramatically, but the need for
foundational knowledge and careful guidance remains crucial for successful
AI-assisted development.
