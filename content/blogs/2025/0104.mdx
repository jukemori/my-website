## Welcome to my blog!

I'm so excited to start this blog!! As a software engineer, I'm going to use
this blog to write about tech, lifestyle, and whatever else pops into my head.

The reason I'm starting this blog is because my ex coworker,
[Kohei](https://github.com/tofujlg) was blogging from his
[website](https://www.jujekebab.com/) and I wanted to try it out.

I'm not a journal person, but I think it's a good way to leave a record of
what's going on in my life and look back on it later. Sometimes I write
technical blogs on [medium](https://medium.com/@jukemori), but I want to write
less professional blogs here and not worry about the quality of my writing.

## So I created my new website

Since the first week of January is holiday in Japan, I decided to create my blog
site before my work starts. I created this website using Next.js, TailwindCSS,
Typescript, and MDX. I was gonna use Sanity or other headless CMS but Kohei
recommended me to keep the blog data in files just because it's simpler. Plus,
if I ever want to switch platforms, I can just move my files. So I decided to
use this simple way.

It was actually very simple to create a blog site with Next.js and MDX.

Here's how you can create blog.ts in the lib folder to generate blog posts from
the files in the content/blogs folder:

```ts
// lib/blog.ts

interface BlogPost {
  slug: string
  title: string
  date: string
  content: string
}

export function getBlogPosts(): BlogPost[] {
  const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'content/blogs')
  const files = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory)

  const posts = files.map((fileName) => {
    const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, fileName)
    const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8')
    const { data, content } = matter(fileContents)

    return {
      slug: fileName.replace(/\.mdx$/, ''),
      title: data.title,
      date: data.date,
      content,
    }
  })

  return posts.sort(
    (a, b) => new Date(b.date).getTime() - new Date(a.date).getTime(),
  )
}
```

To render the blog list, consider using the following approach:

```tsx
import { getBlogPosts } from '@/lib/blog'
import Link from 'next/link'

export default async function BlogPage() {
  const posts = await getBlogPosts()

  return (
    <div className="pb-24">
      <h1 className="mb-8 text-3xl font-bold">Blog Posts</h1>
      <ul className="space-y-4">
        {posts.map((post) => (
          <li key={post.slug} className="rounded-lg border p-4">
            <Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">{post.title}</h3>
              <time className="text-sm text-gray-500">{post.date}</time>
            </Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

An example of writing a blog in markdown:

```mdx

title: 'My First Blog'
date: '2025-01-05'
slug: 'my-first-blog'

## Welcome to my blog!
```

My goal is to write at least one blog post per month! Let's see how it goes!
