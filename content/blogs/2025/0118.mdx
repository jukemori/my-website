I just finished building a full-stack calendar app. The idea actually came from
my girlfriend. She suggested creating a shared calendar for our schedules
because I always forget plans with her.

Check out the live demo [here](https://mingletime.vercel.app/).

## The Journey

I started setting it up last September but put it on hold when I got busy with
job hunting. After landing a job, I picked it back up in November. Usually, I
start projects but abandon them halfway because something doesn’t feel right.
This time, I stuck with it all the way through deployment, and it feels amazing
to finally see it completed!

## Features of the App

The app allows users to:

- Create multiple calendars
- Share calendars with others
- Share and edit notes for shared calendars

For the first time, I implemented WebSockets to enable live notifications, which
was a fun challenge to figure out.

## Lessons Learned

It’s actually the first project I’ve fully completed and deployed since
graduating from the Le Wagon bootcamp. The idea itself isn’t really original,
but I believe the most important thing is to build something on your own, no
matter how simple it is.

For this project, I used:

- **Next.js**
- **Tailwind**
- **ShadCN UI**
- **Ruby on Rails**
- **Docker**

## Why Building Projects Matters

Building projects is one of the best ways to learn coding. I started by:

- Designing the schema
- Planning the app’s structure
- Working on the UI
- Debugging everything myself

It took a lot of time and effort, but I learned so much in the process.

## What's Next?

For my next project, I want to focus more on:

- Performance optimization
- Writing clean, maintainable code

My goal is to complete another full-stack application by the end of the year!
