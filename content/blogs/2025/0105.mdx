# Welcome to My First Blog Post!

This is an example of a rich blog post with various formatting elements. You can write **bold text**, _italic text_, or even **_bold and italic_** together!

## Code Examples

Here's how you can write code blocks:

```javascript
const greeting = 'Hello, World!'
console.log(greeting)
```

### Lists and Quotes

Here's a list of my favorite programming languages:

1. TypeScript
2. Python
3. Rust

And some unordered items:

- React is awesome
- Next.js makes development fun
- MDX allows component usage in markdown

> This is a blockquote. You can use it to highlight important information or quotes from other sources.

## Images and Components

Here's an example of an image:

And you can even use custom React components:

### Tables

| Feature     | Description         | Support |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------- |
| MDX         | Markdown + JSX      | âœ…      |
| Images      | Static and dynamic  | âœ…      |
| Code Blocks | Syntax highlighting | âœ…      |

## Final Thoughts

This is just a sample of what you can do with MDX! You can:

- Mix and match Markdown with JSX
- Import and use React components
- Style your content however you want
- Add interactive elements
