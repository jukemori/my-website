## So it's this time of the year again.

Last year I made 9 resolutions that I wanted to achieve. I only managed to
achieve 1 which was to secure a new developer job. It was a good because that
was the first thing I wanted to achieve.

This year I don't want to make too many resolutions so that I don't go all over
the place.

Here are my new year resolutions:

1. To give 100% to my job.
2. Build a full stack application and deploy it.
3. Be healthy.

### 1. To give 100% to my job.

My priority last year was to secure a new developer job, so I was not able to
give 100% to my job. My head was always somewhere else thinking about the job
search, interview preparation, assignments, etc. My output in my job was not the
best because I was not focused.

This year I want to give 100% to my job. I want to be the person that people can
rely on and the person that people can count on. I want to build trust with my
colleagues and the company.

Besides, I'll be working in a new company. Switching from digital consulting to
a service company is a big change. It's going to be challenging because It's my
first time developing an in-house product. I want to make a good impression and
show them that I'm a good employee and a good developer.

### 2. Build a full stack application and deploy it.

From November last year after I got a job offer, I started building a full stack
application. It's already up and running but it still needs bug fixes and
improvements, but I learned that building a project is the best way to learn. I
also learned that projects are the best resume and the best way to show your
skills.

I'll spend beginning of the year working on this project that I started last
year but I want to start working on a new project this year and make production
ready.

### 3. Be healthy.

Physical health has always been important to me because as a programmer I sit
all day and I need to take care of my body. So I always try to stay active and I
want to continue to do so this year.

I currently:

- Box on weekdays
- Play football on weekends

For 2025, I want to build these habits:

1. Setting up a consistent sleep schedule (11:00 PM - 7:00 AM)
2. Cooking my own meals and eating healthy
3. Staying hydrated (at least 2L of water daily)

Most importantly, I want to stay injury free through stretching. Because the
most important thing is that I can play football and box throughout the year.

### Wrapping up

I'm excited for this year and I hope it's going to be a good year!!
