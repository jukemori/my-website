# I Officially Quit My Permanent Job

After 2 years in tech, I've made the leap to freelancing. This was always the
goal when I decided to switch to a tech career. In other industries, becoming
independent is much harder, but in tech, the path to freelancing is more
accessible. Having worked permanent roles my whole career, I've always been
curious about life outside the corporate ladder. There are so many ways to make
a living, and I think experiencing freelancing is valuable for personal growth.

## Leaving the Best Company I've Worked For

My previous startup was honestly the best company I've ever worked for. The
engineering team was incredibly skilled, and everyone was genuinely nice. The
job was fully remote with complete flexibility and no core hours.

I only worked there for 10 months. I really wanted to stay longer, but with
inflation being what it is these days and the Japanese yen being so weak, I had
to make more money.

## The Job Hunt

I used agencies to find freelance work, and they were upfront with me: it's
tough to land freelance roles with only 2 years of experience. Most companies
want 3+ years for freelance developers, so my chances were slim.

I created my resume anyway and kept interviewing with companies that showed
interest. After 6 interviews, I received offers from 2 companies. I chose the
role based on the tech stack, which was exactly what I wanted to work with.

## Freelance Life So Far

The current work is great. It's fully remote, and I'm earning significantly more
than my previous job. The trade-off is handling taxes and insurance myself, but
I think learning this administrative side is valuable life experience anyway.

The pay will be unstable, and I'll always need to keep my resume and portfolio
updated. Contract renewals will be a constant concern. But honestly? It's
exciting to work with different companies rather than being tied to just one.

## Gratitude for My Previous Team

I worked at 2 tech companies before making this transition. The engineers at my
second company were exceptionally skilled, and I learned so much as a developer.
I wouldn't have been able to land a freelance role in just 2 years without that
experience.

I really appreciate everyone I worked with. They helped me grow more than they
probably realize.

## Looking Forward

This is just the beginning of my freelance journey. I'm excited to see where it
takes me. I'll get to work on many codebases and projects. I also want to try
getting global clients next year.
