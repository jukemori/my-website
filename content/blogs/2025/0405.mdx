### The 3 Month Milestone

It's been 3 months since I joined the new company. Looking back, I can clearly
see my growth. I've now explored almost every folder in the project.

The first month was really tough. I had to work late at night and on the
weekends to complete tasks quickly. It's rewarding to see how much faster I can
implement features now compared to my first month.

I've learned that adapting to new tech doesn't take as long as I thought. The
beginning is hard, but using it regularly makes learning happen much faster. Now
I feel confident adopting new technologies even though I work at a company that
uses different tech stacks.

I believe that growth comes from doing things you're initially unqualified for.
That's when you push beyond perceived limits. This job consistently placed me
outside my comfort zone, forcing me to learn fast.

### Outside of work

Even with the crazy work hours, I still found time for fun stuff. Got to hit the
slopes for snowboarding twice - totally needed that rush of cold air!

Made it to two of my high school buddies' weddings. Pretty wild seeing everyone
all grown up and getting married. Great chance to catch up with the old crew.

Best part was probably hanging out with my college friend after 7 years. We used
to play soccer together back in the day. Exploring Tokyo with him brought back
so many memories. ![fishing](/images/blogs/2025/0405/sub2.webp)

Oh, and our team won the futsal tournament!

### Next goals

Now that I'm comfortable at work, I want to spend my free time on my own
projects.
